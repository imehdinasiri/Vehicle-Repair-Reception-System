# Vehicle Acceptance and Repair Management System

## Description

This repository contains a database-driven application developed for managing the acceptance and repair workflow of damaged vehicles in an automotive service center. The system is designed to streamline customer and vehicle data entry, maintenance tracking, and report generation through modular Python scripts and a relational database schema.

## Features

- Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing customer and vehicle records
- Modular architecture with separation of logic for configuration, operations, and reporting
- Custom report generation using SQL queries for business insights
- Clean and scalable code structure, easily adaptable to larger systems
- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) included for data model visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pyodbc` package (`pip install pyodbc`)
- Microsoft SQL Server or compatible RDBMS

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imehdinasiri/Vehicle-Repair-Reception-System

2. Configure the database:

   Use the ERD (diagrams/erd.png) or manually run the schema using your DB tool.

   Ensure the connection details in db_config.py are correct.

3. Execute SQL Scripts

   Before running the project, make sure to create the database and required tables by executing the SQL scripts provided.
   
   CREATE DATABASE CarRepairDB;

4. Run the CLI-based CRUD Application
   
   After executing the required SQL queries to set up the database and tables, proceed with the CLI-based CRUD application.
   The main functionalities are implemented in three parts:

    -crud_operations.py: Contains functions for inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data from the database.

    -db_config.py: Manages the connection to the SQL Server using pyodbc.

    -main.py: The CLI interface where the user interacts with the application.

    To start the application, run: main.py

5.  Generate Reports

    After inserting records through the CRUD system, you can generate reports based on the stored data using the report_generator.py module.

    To access the reporting menu, run: main.py

    You'll be presented with a terminal-based menu with the following report options:

    -Total Income from Services and Parts
    Calculates total revenue earned from both services and parts in a given date range.

    -Number of Car Receptions
    Displays how many vehicles were accepted in the workshop during a selected period.

    -Repairs by Type and Income
    Groups repairs by type and calculates total income generated by each.

    -Repair Costs by Car Plate
    Shows how much each vehicle has cost in repairs over the given time range.

    -Top 20 Frequent Customers
    Lists the 20 customers with the highest number of service visits.

    -Exit
    Closes the report menu.

    Each option asks for a start date and end date in YYYY-MM-DD format to filter the results.

    These reports use SQL JOINs and aggregation functions to summarize and display key insights from the database.
